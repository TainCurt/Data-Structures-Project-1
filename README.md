# Mini Project 1 â€“ List (Data Structures)

This project provides custom implementations of selected data structures in **C++**, along with performance testing of specific operations.

## Project Topic: List

Implemented data structures:

1. **Dynamic Array (ArrayList)**  
   The array has a fixed initial size and doubles its capacity when full.

2. **Singly Linked List**  
   Implementation based on two pointers: `head` and `tail`.

3. **Doubly Linked List**  
   Classic doubly linked structure with pointers to the previous and next elements.

---

## Analyzed Operations

Each data structure is benchmarked based on the time taken to perform the following operations:

- **Insertion** at:
  - the **beginning**,
  - the **end**,
  - a **random position**.

- **Deletion** from:
  - the **beginning**,
  - the **end**,
  - a **random position**.

- **Searching**:
  - A random number is generated and searched within the structure.
